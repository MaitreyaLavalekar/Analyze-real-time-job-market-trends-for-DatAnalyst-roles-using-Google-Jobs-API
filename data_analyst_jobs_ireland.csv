About us

auticon is an IT Consultancy and Social Enterprise whose mission is to address the inequalities in employment for neurodivergent adults. We aim to provide long-term career opportunities for autistic adults, who we employ as IT and Data Consultants. They then deliver high-quality services to our clients. If you’re not familiar with how IT Consultancies operate, read more on our UK blog.

We’re expanding our client network in Ireland and anticipate having opportunities for Data Consultants based within commuting distance of central Dublin to join our team.

As autism is the cornerstone of our social mission, we do ask applicants for these roles to provide evidence they’re in the process of obtaining an autism diagnosis, evidence they have a diagnosis, or alternative documentation to evidence autism.

What the role involves

You’ll join our team of Consultants and be a permanent employee of auticon, but most of your day-to-day work will be with one of our clients. You’ll add skills and expertise to the client’s team or project. Most of our clients are large multinational organisations who require expertise in areas such as data analysis, data visualisation, data engineering, cyber security, machine learning or AI. You get the chance to work on interesting assignments with our clients, whilst still having all the support of being an auticon employee. When you’re between projects, your employment with us continues.

Visit our UK blog to learn more about the value of the coaching we provide.

How we recruit

We always want to hear from autistic people with strong tech and data skills who would like to join us. We invite people to apply to join our Data Consultant Talent Pool, which is slightly different from applying for a specific job. Our 4-stage process is designed to assess your suitability for the role of Data Consultant. By Stage 3, we’ll have gained a detailed understanding of your skills and interests that will allow us to create an auticon Consultant Profile for you. We can then begin the process of matching you to a first client project. Although we offer permanent contracts of employment with us, auticon, as your employer, we like to have a first client project lined up before we make you an offer. It’s important to us to be transparent that there is no set timeframe for how long this will take as it depends on client demand.

What we offer
• A salary of €30,000 – €47,000 (normally €30,000 – €36,000 for Consultants with lower levels of work experience or €33,000 – €47,000 for Consultants with more relevant work experience or practical application of skills via a PhD, for example)
• Permanent contract that includes valuable autism-tailored benefits, such as ongoing assistance from a dedicated Coach who provides practical and emotional support to help you thrive in your role
• 25 days annual leave, plus bank holidays
• Private health insurance package
• Friendly and productive work environment where reasonable adjustments are understood and encouraged
• Personal development with fully funded courses

What we’re looking for

Essential Criteria – please apply if you have:
• Evidence you’re in the process of obtaining an autism diagnosis OR evidence you already have a diagnosis OR alternative documentation to evidence autism
• The ability to commute to central Dublin on a regular basis, around 2-3 times per week (As a responsible employer, we’re aware of the sensory and emotional impact of longer commutes. We consider a reasonable commute to be no longer than 1.5 hours each way.)
• Strong Python skills, including the use of relevant libraries (NumPy, pandas, etc.)
• Experience in 2 or 3 of the following:

– Using data analysis tools

– Processing large data sets accurately

– Using relational databases

Desirable Criteria (please note that you don’t need to meet all, or any, of the criteria listed below in order to apply)
• Previously used R, Tableau, Power BI, Qlik, Spotfire, etc.
• Certification in one of the major cloud services (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, etc.)
• Some knowledge/experience of machine learning (e.g. TensorFlow)
• Cyber security skills, experience or certification (e.g. CompTIA)
• Some relevant work experience, or equivalent practical application of skills through a PhD, for example

Due to the differing needs of our clients, we can’t guarantee an entirely remote role, and commuting into central Dublin around 2-3 times per week may be required. However, as we appreciate the impact that commuting and office environments can have on our Consultants, we ensure reasonable adjustments are implemented and encourage flexible or hybrid working arrangements where possible.

Successful candidates must have ongoing permission to work in Ireland.

Inclusion Statement

We’re committed to equality of opportunity in all areas of our work. You’ll be treated in a fair and equal manner regardless of your gender, marital status, race, religion, age, disability or sexual orientation.
